â€¢ any original values in the receiver that can change as a result of handling
the request. The receiver must provide operations that let the command
return the receiver to its prior state.
To support one level of undo, an application needs to store only the com-
mand that was executed last. For multiple-level undo and redo, the applica-
tion needs a history list of commands that have been executed, where the
maximum length of the list determines the number of undo/redo levels. The
history list stores sequences of commands that have been executed. Travers-
ing backward through the list and reverse-executing commands cancels their
effect; traversing forward and executing commands reexecutes them.
