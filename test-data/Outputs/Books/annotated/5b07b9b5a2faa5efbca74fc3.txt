Once the rapid prototype is complete and has been ap-
proved by the client and checked by the SQA group, a team will be
set up to investigate the possible risks if the project were continued
as well as how to minimize those risks. If this second team reports
that there are now serious risks that cannot be resolved, such as that
the resulting product may not be cost-effective, then the project will
immediately be terminated. But if all risks can be satisfactorily
resolved, management will proceed with the project confident that
the necessary precautions will have been taken to minimize all the
risks that have so far been identified. The decision will therefore be
made to proceed with the specification phase and thereafter to
perform a further round of risk analysis before making the decision
whether to commit recources to the planning phase.
