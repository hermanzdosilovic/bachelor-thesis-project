Figure 34.7 Three basic logic gates, with binary inputs and outputs. Under each gate is the truth
table that describes the gate′s operation. (a) The NOT gate. (b) The AND gate. (c) The OR gate.
example, the truth table for the OR gate tells us that when the inputs are x = 0
and y = 1, the output value is z = 1. We use the symbols - to denote the NOT
function, i to denote the AND function, and v to denote the OR function. Thus,
for example, 0 v 1 = 1.
We can generalize AND and OR gates to take more than two inputs. An AND
gate′s output is 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and its output is 0 otherwise. An OR gate′s
output is 1 if any of its inputs are 1, and its output is 0 otherwise.
circuits, differing in only one gate. Part (a) of the figure also shows the values on
the individual wires, given the input (x1 = 1, x2 = 1 , x3 = 0). Although a single
wire may have no more than one combinational-element output connected to it, it
can feed several element inputs. The number of element inputs fed by a wire is
called the fan-out of the wire. If no element output is connected to a wire, the wire
is a circuit input, accepting input values from an external source. If no element
input is connected to a wire, the wire is a circuit output, providing the results of
