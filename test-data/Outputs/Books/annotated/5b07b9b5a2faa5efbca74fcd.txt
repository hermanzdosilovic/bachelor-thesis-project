Often there are dependencies between the widgets in the dialog. For example,
a button gets disabled when a certain entry field is empty. Selecting an entry
in a list of choices called a list box might change the contents of an entry field.
Conversely, typing text into the entry field might automatically select one or more
corresponding entries in the list box. Once text appears in the entry field, other
buttons may become enabled that let the user do something with the text, such as
changing or deleting the thing to which it refers.
Different dialog boxes will have different dependencies between widgets. So even
though dialogs display the same kinds of widgets, they can't simply reuse stock
widget classes; they have to be customized to reflect dialog-specific dependencies.
Customizing them individually by subclassing will be tedious, since many classes
are involved.
