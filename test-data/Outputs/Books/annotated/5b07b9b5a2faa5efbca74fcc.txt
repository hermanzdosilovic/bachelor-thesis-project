Known Uses
The Interpreter pattern is widely used in compilers implemented with object-
oriented languages, as the Smalltalk compilers are. SPECTalk uses the pattern to
interpret descriptions of input file formats [Sza92]. The QOCA constraint-solving
toolkit uses it to evaluate constraints [HHMV92].
Considered in its most general form (i.e., an operation distributed over a class
hierarchy based on the Composite pattern), nearly every use of the Composite
pattern will also contain the Interpreter pattern. But the Interpreter pattern should
be reserved for those cases in which you want to think of the class hierarchy as
defining d language.
