4.3 The Relevant Alleles Preserving Genetic Algorithm
(RAPGA)
Assuming generational replacement as the underlying replacement strategy
the most essential question at generation i is which parts of genetic infor-
mation from generation i should be maintained in generation i+1 and how
this could be done most effectively applying the available information (chro-
mosomes and according fitness values) and the available genetic operators
selection, crossover, and mutation.
The here presented variant of enhanced algorithmic concepts based upon
GA-solution manipulation operators aims to achieve this goal by trying to
bring out as much progress from the actual generation as possible and losing
as little genetic diversity as possible at the same time.
