Fortunately the inputs so far have all been well formed, but our luck is unlikely to
interpreted languages, it is common to check the syntax for static errors, that is,
can be detected without running the program. By separating the static checks
dynamic ones, we can detect errors sooner and perform many checks only once
each time an expression is evaluated.
Let′s add another method to the Expr interface. The Check method checks for
an expression syntax tree. We′ll explain its vars parameter in a moment.
