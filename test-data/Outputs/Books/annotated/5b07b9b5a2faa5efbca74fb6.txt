Unfortunately, the formal proof that the circuit-satisfiability problem
complete requires technical detail beyond the scope of this text. Instead,
informally describe a proof that relies on a basic understanding of boolean
national circuits.
Boolean combinational circuits are built from boolean combinationale
that are interconnected by wires. A boolean combinational element is any
element that has a constant number ofboolean inputs and outputs and that pe
a well-defined function. Boolean values are drawn from the set {0, 1},
represents FALSE and 1 represents TRUE.
