The standard off-line heuristics for bin packing order the objects by si
shape and then insert them into bins. Typical insertion rules are (1) select the
or leftmost bin the object fits in, (2) select the bin with the most room, (3) s
the bin that provides the tightest fit, or (4) select a random bin.
Analytical and empirical results suggest that first-fit decreasing is the
heuristic. Sort the objects in decreasing order of size, so that the biggest o
is first and the smallest last. Insert each object one by one into the first bin
has room for it. If no bin has room, we must start another bin. In the ca
one-dimensional bin packing, this can never require more than 22% more bins
necessary and usually does much better. First-fit decreasing has an intuitive a
to it, for we pack the bulky objects first and hope that little objects can fill u
cracks.
