Sample Code
The C++ code shown here sketches the implementation of the Command classes
in the Motivation section. Weâ€²ll define OpenCommand, PasteCommand, and
MacroCommand. First the abstract Command class:
class Command {
public:
virtual ~Command();
virtual void Execute() = 0;
protected:
Command();
};
OpenCommand opens a document whose name is supplied by the user. An
OpenCommand must be passed an Application object in its constructor.
AskUser is an implementation routine that prompts the user for the name of
the document to open.
