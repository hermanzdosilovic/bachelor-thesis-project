Simulating Evolution: Basics about Genetic Algorithms 9
1.4.3 Mutation
Mutations allow undirected jumps to slightly different areas of the search
space. The basic mutation operator for binary coded problems is bitwise
mutation. Mutation occurs randomly and very rarely with a probability pm;
typically, this mutation rate is than ten percent. In some cases mutation
is interpreted as generating a new bit and in others it is interpreted as flipping
the bit.
In higher order alphabets, such as integer numbering formulations, muta-
tion takes the form of replacing an allele with a randomly chosen value in the
appropriate range with probability pm. However, for combinatorial optimiza-
tion problems, such mutation schemes can cause difficulties with chromosome
legality; for example, multiple copies of a given value can occur which might
be illegal for some problems (including routing). Alternatives suggested in
literature include pairwise swap and shift operations as for instance described
in [Car94].
