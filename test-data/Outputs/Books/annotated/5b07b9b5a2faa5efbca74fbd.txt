1.6 War Story: Psychic Modeling
The call came for me out of the blue as I sat in my office.
″Professor Skiena, I hope you can help me. I′m the President of Lotto Systems
Group Inc., and we need an algorithm for a problem arising in our latest product.″
″Sure," I replied. After all, the dean of my engineering school is always encour-
aging our faculty to interact more with industry.
″At Lotto Systems Group, we market a program designed to improve our cus-
tomers′ psychic ability to predict winning lottery numbers.1 In a standard lottery,
each ticket consists of six numbers selected from, say, 1 to 44. Thus, any given
ticket has only a very small chance of winning. However, after proper training, our
clients can visualize, say, 15 numbers out of the 44 and be certain that at least four
of them will be on the winning ticket. Are you with me so far?″
″Probably not," I replied. But then I recalled how my dean encourages us to
interact with industry.
