Chapter 34 NP-Completeness
a. Formulate a related decision problem for the independent-set problem, a
prove that it is NP-complete. (Hint: Reduce from the clique problem.)
b. Suppose that you are given "black-box" a subroutine to solve the decision poob
lem you defined in part (a). Give an algorithm to find an independent set of ma
imum size. The running time of your algorithm should be polynomial in |V
and |E|, counting queries to the black box as a single step.
Although the independent-set decision problem is NP-complete, certain speci
cases are polynomial-time solvable.
c. Give an efficient algorithm to solve the independent-set problem when each ve
tex in G has degree 2. Analyze the running time, and prove that your algorith
works correctly.
