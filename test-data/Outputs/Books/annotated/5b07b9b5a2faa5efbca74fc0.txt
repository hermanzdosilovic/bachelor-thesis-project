Introduction
Essentially, this book is about algorithmic developments in the context of
genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP); we also describe
their applications to significant combinatorial optimization problems as well
as structure identification using HeuristicLab as a platform for algorithm de-
velopment. The main issue of the theoretical considerations is to obtain a
better understanding of the basic workflow of GAs and GP, in order to estab-
lish new bionic, problem independent theoretical concepts and to substantially
increase the achievable solution quality.
