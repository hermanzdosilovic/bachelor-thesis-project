it Distance by Recursion
e a recursive algorithm using the observation that the last character in
st either be matched, substituted, inserted, or deleted. Chopping off
s involved in this last edit operation leaves a pair of smaller strings.
e the last character of the relevant prefix of P and T, respectively.
ee pairs of shorter strings after the last operation, corresponding to
ter a match/substitution, insertion, or deletion. If we knew the cost
se three pairs of smaller strings, we could decide which option leads
olution ann choose that option accordingly. We can learn this cost
agic of recursion.
isely, let D[i,j] be the minimum number of differences between
and the segment of T ending at j. D[i,j] is the minimum of the
ways to extend smaller string:
Tj), then D[i-1,j-1], else D[i-1,j-1]+1. This means we either
r substitute the ith and jth characters, depending upon whether the
acters are the same.
