2.5 Reasoning About Efficiency
Gross reasoning about an algorithmâ€²s running time of is usually easy given a precise
written description of the algorithm. In this section, I will work through several
examples, perhaps in greater detail than necessary.
2.5.1 Selection Sort
Here we analyze the selection sort algorithm, which repeatedly identifies the small-
est remaining unsorted element and puts it at the end of the sorted portion of the
array. An animation of selection sort in action appears in Figure 2.5, and the code
is shown below:
